Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Mr. Buckner,

 For delivered gas behind San Diego, Enron Energy Services is the appropriate 
Enron entity.  I have forwarded your request to Zarin Imam at EES.  Her phone

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?
Brenda

Jim,

Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the gas desk is included.

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Phillip Allen

 I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written 
approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has 
concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like 
to review the closing statements as soon as possible.

Brenda,

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

Jeff,

 I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I 
am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
 I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out 
when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?

 What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember

  9/8  9/7  diff

Socal  36,600  37,200  -600

NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250

San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500


The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the 
transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan 
and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and 
sold 800 Socal.

why is aeco basis so low on the list?  Is NWPL mapped differently than AECO?  
What about the correlation to Nymex on AECO?"

Jeff,

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.  

Phillip"

Subject: Sagewood Town Homes


I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Phillip"

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. ""That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."" 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads,"" said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."" 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       ""It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country,"" boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       ""We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,""
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way.""

We have not received your completed Team Selection information.  It is
imperative that we receive your team's information (email, phone number,
office) asap.  We cannot start your administration without this information,
and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Got your message.  Good luck on the bike ride.

 What were you doing to your apartment?  Are you setting up a studio?

 The kids are back in school.  Otherwise just work is going on here.

Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Phillip

Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

 We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the 
spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to 
an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two

Open the ""utility"" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel.

Phillip,

I got this request.  On the gas side, I think Kean/Lay need an update to a table you prepared for me a few months ago, which I've attached..  Can you oblige?  Thanks,

Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the ""stupid regulatory/legislative decisions"" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's ""Ken Lay Tour"" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Phillip"

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the ""Checkbook"" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip

can you build something to look at historical prices from where we saved 
curves each night.

Here is an example that pulls socal only.
Improvements could include a drop down menu to choose any curve and a choice 
of index,gd, or our curves.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Wade,

 I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle 
situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the 
tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) 
if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and 
you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your 
income.

Phillip"

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Thank you,

Phillip"

Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022.

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Al,

I am not in good enough shape to ride a century right now.  Plus I'm nursing 
some injuries.  I can do lunch this week or next, let's pick a day.

Brenda,

 The word document attached is a notice/consent form for the sale.  The excel 
file is an amortization table for the note.
You can use the Additional Principal Reduction to record prepayments.  Please 
email me back to confirm receipt.

Jeff,

 I have spoken to Brenda and everything looks good.  Matt Lutz was supposed 
to email me some language but I did not receive it.  I don't have his # so 
can you follow up.  When is the estimated closing date.  Let me know what 
else I need to be doing.

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Tim,
 Matt sent you a email with his attempt to organize some of the cems and wscc 
data.  Tim H. expressed concern over the reliability of the wscc data.  I 
don't know if we should scrap the wscc or just keep monitoring in case it 
improves.  Let me know what you think.

Lucy,

I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this 
weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying
the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't 
mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade.  
Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   


Thanks,


Dave"

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Ray,

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language ""the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California""?

Scott,

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Phillip"

Lucy,

 I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him.  
 I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary 
to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by this Friday.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" 
generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Let's talk.

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Phillip Allen

Lucy,

 Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.  You can keep 
a log on paper or on the computer.  The computer would be better for sending 
me updates.

  

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be 
more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments.
We can adjust office hours on another day.

 I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion 
adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner

Al,

I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds 
like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your 
email all is well with you.   That's great.  

We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  
What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike 
riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.

My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on 
maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical 
cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  
He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial 
Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the 
road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.

I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch 
sometime.  

Phillip

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Mary,

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 
or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  
12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you 
could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound 
fair?  We can apply it to the loan.

Subject:	Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed   

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners then among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Subject: Re: SW Gas  

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Kay & Neal,

Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  

The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby 
as long as she is being held.

It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready 
to start building.  

We will probably visit in late June or July.  May is busy.  We are taking the 
kids to Disney for their birthdays.

Good luck on the house.

Mary,

I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3.  He agreed that it 
would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to 
#2.  Then they can just focus on #19.  I worked on the books this weekend but 
I need more time to finish.  I will call you in a day or so.

Mac,

I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has 
an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the 
choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier 
service account, but I will have to transfer the money.  

Hopefully this will reach you.

Gary,

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.

Will,


Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Phillip

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it 
take him?  I think $100 should be enough. 

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.

The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve 
adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high
for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  Great job on February.

Phillip"

Frank,

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

Mary,

 I got your email.  Go ahead and get a carpet shampooer.  Make sure it comes 
back clean after each use.  (Wade and the tenants.)

 As far as W-2.  I looked up the rules for withholding and social security.  
I will call you later today to discuss.

Subject: Storage of Cycles at the Body Shop

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee
